# About Me

## Hi there! üëã

I'm Catherine, a budding data scientist with a passion for uncovering insights through data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Though I‚Äôm just starting my career, with 2 months of hands-on experience, I‚Äôm committed to developing my skills and contributing to impactful projects. I'm particularly interested in and excited about the intersection of data science and music, aiming to create innovative solutions in this space.

### üéì Education

I hold a Masters Degree in Data Science from Liverpool Hope University, where I developed a strong foundation in statistical analysis, programming, and data visualization.

### üèÜ Achievements

I was awarded the Department General Proficiency Award while graduating with my Bachelors Degree in Information Technology.

### üíº Experience

I've recently started my career as an associate data scientist, and I've already worked on projects that involve:

- **Python:** Used these languages to clean, analyze, and model insurance data.
- **Data Visualization:** Performed EDA and created dashboards using Power BI to understand the insurance data.
- **Research:** Research and development efforts aimed at building innovative proof-of-concept models in image recognition technology.
